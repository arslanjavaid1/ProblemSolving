/*
Deque (Double-ended Queue)
The reason we use dequeue here is because we need to keep two orders.
1. chronological order of index (we achieve this by always pushing elements to the end and removing elements that are out of window from the front)
2. descending order of values (we pop elements greater than current element)

Algorithm:
1. Process first k elements separately to initialise deque and window.
2. Iterate through the rest of array. At each index, ensure that (1) deque only contains elements in the window and that (2) deque elements are in descending order. After these two conditions are ensured, the first element of deque is the max value of current window.
